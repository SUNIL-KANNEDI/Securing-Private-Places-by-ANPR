# Securing Private Places by ANPR 🚗🔒  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements an **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** system using **YOLOv8** and **Tesseract OCR**.  
It is designed to enhance security by detecting and recognizing license plates of vehicles entering **private places** such as:  
- Residential communities  
- Offices  
- Parking areas  
- Restricted access zones  

The system captures video frames, detects vehicles & number plates using YOLOv8, and extracts plate text with OCR.
